        <div id="intro">Around the world, a small but dedicated group of amateur astronomers track undocumented satellites using mainly consumer telescopes and stopwatches. Most of these are classified military and reconaissance satellites. Others are pieces of debris or items of completely unknown origin. The following are real-time visualizations of the altitude of these spacecraft above the horizon at your current location, as well as cylindrical and polar maps you can use to spot them yourself. Learn more about amateur satellite tracking at the <a href="http://www.satobs.org/">Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page</a><div id="close">close</div></div>
